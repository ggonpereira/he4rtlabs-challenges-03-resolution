<h2>Installation 👨‍💻</h2>

### Before you can start, you have to install this tools in your machine:

- <b>[Git](https://git-scm.com)</b>
- <b>[MySQL](https://www.mysql.com)</b>

### Then:

```
- Clone the repository:
$ git clone https://github.com/ggonpereira/he4rtlabs-challenges-03-resolution.git

- Then access the directory:
$ cd he4rtlabs-challenges-03-resolution

- Now you'll have to create a new database (I recommend this name: "he4rt-03")

- And create a ".env" file in the root directory with this followings infos:
DB_NAME=NAME_OF_DATABASE
DB_HOST=HOST_OF_DATABASE
DB_USER=USER_OF_DB_ADMIN
DB_PASS=PASS_OF_DB_ADMIN
SECRET_PHRASE=LITERALLY_ANYTHING

- And go to "/models/" and remove the comment where says "_____.sync({ force: true });" from "User.js"

- Then, type:
$ npm i

- And:
$ npm start

- When the server is started you can comment again the lines you've removed the comment before and restart the server

- And finally, access: http://localhost

```
